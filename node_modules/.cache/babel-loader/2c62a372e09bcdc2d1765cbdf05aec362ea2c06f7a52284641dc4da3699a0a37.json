Keep your list up to date</h3>\r\n<p className='about-p'>One of the most important tasks each day or week is to think about what you need to do in the next period. Taking time to plan, and particularly to review your overall list and make sure that you move jobs from there to your daily or weekly list as they become urgent, means that you will not forget to do anything on the overall list.\r\n\r\n<p className='about-p'>The time you take to do this need not be more than about five minutes each day, if that.\r\n</p>\r\n<p className='about-p'>You should also check your overall list and remove anything that you realise that you have no intention of doing. This might be because you no longer want to do it, or because the time is past.</p>\r\n</p>\r\n   </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About;"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAO,aAAa;AACpB;AAAA,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AACA,OAAO,MAAMC,KAAK,GAAGA,CAAA,KAAM;EACvB,oBACID,OAAA;IAASE,SAAS,EAAC,OAAO;IAACC,EAAE,EAAC,OAAO;IAAAC,QAAA,eACjCJ,OAAA;MAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,iBAAiB;MAAAE,QAAA,gBAC5BJ,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;QAAAE,QAAA,gBAE1BJ,OAAA;UAAIE,SAAS,EAAC,sBAAsB;UAAAE,QAAA,GAAC,SACjC,eAAAJ,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAM;UAAG;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAO;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eACzBR,OAAA;UAAGE,SAAS,EAAC,qBAAqB;UAAAE,QAAA,GAAC,yGAC/B,eAAAJ,OAAA;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAM,uEAEV;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAEF,eACNR,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,EAAE;QAAAE,QAAA,gBACbJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,eACAJ,OAAA;YAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;YAAAE,QAAA,eACtBJ,OAAA;cAAKS,GAAG,EAAC,yKAAyK;cAACC,GAAG,EAAC,OAAO;cAACR,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;cAACS,KAAK,EAAC,KAAK;cAACC,MAAM,EAAC;YAAK;cAAAP,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA;UAAG;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA;QAC7O;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QACG,eAETR,OAAA;UAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,eAAe;UAAAE,QAAA,gBAC1BJ,OAAA;YAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eACLR,OAAA;YAAIE,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;UAAsB;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eACrDR,OAAA;YAAGE,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;UACwB;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eACnDR,OAAA;YAAGE,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAE;UAIoE;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eAGxHR,OAAA;YAAIE,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;UAA0B;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eAEzDR,OAAA;YAAGE,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;UAA2D;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eAGtFR,OAAA;YAAGE,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;UAG6B;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eAExDR,OAAA;YAAGE,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;UACvB;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eAEJR,OAAA;YAAIE,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;UAA6C;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eAC5ER,OAAA;YAAGE,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;UAAoI;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eAE/JR,OAAA;YAAGE,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;UAEiD;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eAE5ER,OAAA;YAAGE,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;UAA2L;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eAEtNR,OAAA;YAAGE,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;UAAsI;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eAEjKR,OAAA;YAAGE,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;UAAkL;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eAI7MR,OAAA;YAAIE,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;UAA4C;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eAC3ER,OAAA;YAAGE,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;UASvB;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eAEJR,OAAA;YAAIE,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;UAA4B;YAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eAC3DR,OAAA;YAAGE,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;YAAAE,QAAA,GAAC,iVAEvB,eAAAJ,OAAA;cAAGE,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;YACvB;cAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,QAAI,eACJR,OAAA;cAAGE,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAC;YAAiM;cAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,QAAI;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QACxN;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QACK;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACa;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA;EACJ;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,QACA;AAGlB,CAAC;AAAAK,EAAA,GAtFYZ,KAAK;AAwFlB,eAAeA,KAAK;AAAC,IAAAY,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
